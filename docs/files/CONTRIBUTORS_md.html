<h2 id="label-Our+Responsibilities">Our Responsibilities</h2>

<p>Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of
acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair
corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.</p>

<p>Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem
inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.</p>

<h2 id="label-Scope">Scope</h2>

<p>This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public
spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.
Examples of representing a project or community include using an official
project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or
acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.
Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project
maintainers.</p>

<h2 id="label-Enforcement">Enforcement</h2>

complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response

team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter
of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be
